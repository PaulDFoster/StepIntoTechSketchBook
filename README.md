StepIntoTech Tech-a-thon Sketchbook
===========================

Contains Arduino sketches for:

1. The Arduino Grove Starter Kit V3
1. Additional Grove Air quality, Dust and Temp&Humi sensors
1. The Things Uno

Contains the library directories required for all the sensors and The Things Network.

<b>To use the sketchbook easily, set your Sketchbook location in the Arduino IDE via File -> Preferences to point to the directory where you have unzipped this repository. </b>

You can then access the sketches and library examples via the:

1. File -> Sketches menu
1. File -> Examples menu (at the bottom in custom library section)

Each sketch says how to connect the sensor it uses in the comments at the top.

<b>To set up The Things Uno to connect to The Things Network follow the set up here, note that you do not need to install The Things Network library as it is already in the sketchbook for you.</b>

Getting started information for Arduino and the Seeed Studio Grove Starter Kit for Arduino V3 can be found here:

By exploring each sensor on the Seeed Studio Wiki site you will find examples and resources to help you use the sensor.

Lots of example projects you can explore and maybe build can be found on Hackster.io by searching for Grove:
